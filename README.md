# Gender Prediction and Education Data Analysis Projects

This GitHub repo hosts two separate machine learning projects focused on gender prediction and training data analysis. Both projects aim to extract information from data sets and make accurate predictions using Naive Bayes classifiers.

## Gender Prediction Project

The gender prediction project aims to predict the gender of individuals based on various characteristics. Within the scope of this project, training and test data sets are processed, categorical data are converted to numerical values and the Gaussian Naive Bayes model is trained. The performance of the model is evaluated by predictions on the training dataset and a classification report is generated.

## Education Data Analysis Project

The education data analysis project analyzes students' exam scores and passing status. The project splits the dataset into training and testing subsets and calculates and evaluates performance metrics using both Gaussian and Multinomial Naive Bayes models.

## Instructions for Use

To use the projects, you must first install the necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `numpy`). Then, simply download the datasets, place them in the relevant directories, and run the Python scripts.
